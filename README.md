## About This Project

It is used to help determine what waste goes into which container by using user webcams to detect images. <br />
Currently it is divided into Compose, Recycleable, Paper, and Garbage. <br />
Our hope is that this technology can be used in the future to create automated sorting machine. <br />

## Technologies Used
